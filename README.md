# 🏦 Loan Approval Prediction using Deep Learning

This project predicts whether a loan application should be **approved or rejected** based on applicant financial and demographic information.  
A **Neural Network model** is used to analyze patterns in historical loan data and classify applications accurately.

## 📌 Project Overview

Loan approval decisions involve evaluating factors like income, credit history, employment status, loan amount, dependents, and more.

In this project, I:

1. Cleaned and preprocessed the loan dataset  
2. Converted categorical features into numerical values  
3. Scaled numerical features for faster training  
4. Built a **Deep Learning classification model** using **TensorFlow & Keras**  
5. Tuned hyperparameters to improve accuracy and generalization
